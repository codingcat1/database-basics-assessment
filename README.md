#####Requirements:
Ruby, terminal, PostgreSQL

#####Instructions:
Download zip file.  Open terminal, and change directory to location of the file.  In terminal, type "$ ruby blood_tracker_ui.rb." Have fun!

#####Known Bugs/Functionalities not yet created:
- When user assigns a Blood Type id to a Donation Location id, any input that is not an existing id will be input into the database as '0'
- User must input ID # of the items, instead of the name.  In the future, planning on swapping this so that user can input the name and also have names returned.
- User cannot yet delete existing Blood Types or Donation Locations.
